 Adding some text again having restored changes.

After you add a file to staging step with git. if you run:

git restore --staged <filename>

then you will remove it from the staging step.

If you then run:

git restore <filename> 

on the same file (or any file that isn't in staging area but has been modified since last snapshot) then you will revert changes on that file to previous snapshot.
